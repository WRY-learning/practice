Kaspersky Lab has always worked closely with vendors to protect users .
As soon as we find new vulnerabilities we immediately inform the vendor in a responsible manner and provide all the details required for a fix .
On October 10 , 2017 , Kaspersky Lab's advanced exploit prevention systems identified a new Adobe Flash zero day exploit used in the wild against our customers .
The exploit was delivered through a Microsoft Office document and the final payload was the latest version of FinSpy malware .
We have reported the bug to Adobe who assigned it CVE-2017-11292 and released a patch earlier today : 
Vulnerability details : Vulnerability Category : Type Confusion , Vulnerability Impact : Remote Code Execution , Severity : Critical , CVE Number : CVE-2017-11292 .
So far only one attack has been observed in our customer base , leading us to believe the number of attacks are minimal and highly targeted .
Analysis of the payload allowed us to confidently link this attack to an actor we track as "BlackOasis" .
We are also highly confident that BlackOasis was also responsible for another zero day exploit ( CVE-2017-8759 ) discovered by FireEye in September 2017 .
The FinSpy payload used in the current attacks ( CVE-2017-11292 ) shares the same command and control ( C2 ) server as the payload used with CVE-2017-8759 uncovered by FireEye .
We first became aware of BlackOasis' activities in May 2016 , while investigating another Adobe Flash zero day .
On May 10 , 2016 , Adobe warned of a vulnerability ( CVE-2016-4117 ) affecting Flash Player 21.0.0.226 and earlier versions for Windows , Macintosh , Linux , and Chrome OS .
The vulnerability was actively being exploited in the wild .
Kaspersky Lab was able to identify a sample exploiting this vulnerability that was uploaded to a multi scanner system on May 8 , 2016 .
The sample , in the form of an RTF document , exploited CVE-2016-4117 to download and install a program from a remote C&C server .
Although the exact payload of the attack was no longer in the C&C , the same server was hosting multiple FinSpy installation packages .
Leveraging data from Kaspersky Security Network , we identified two other similar exploit chains used by BlackOasis in June 2015 which were zero days at the time .
Those include CVE-2015-5119 and CVE-2016-0984 , which were patched in July 2015 and February 2016 respectively .
These exploit chains also delivered FinSpy installation packages .
Since the discovery of BlackOasis' exploitation network , we've been tracking this threat actor with the purpose of better understanding their operations and targeting and have seen a couple dozen new attacks .
To summarize , we have seen BlackOasis utilizing at least five zero days since June 2015: CVE-2015-5119 – June 2015 , CVE-2016-0984 – June 2015 , CVE-2016-4117 – May 2016 , CVE-2017-8759 – Sept 2017 , CVE-2017-11292 – Oct 2017 .
The attack begins with the delivery of an Office document , presumably in this instance via e-mail .
Embedded within the document is an ActiveX object which contains the Flash exploit .
The Flash object contains an ActionScript which is responsible for extracting the exploit using a custom packer seen in other FinSpy exploits .
The exploit is a memory corruption vulnerability that exists in the "com.adobe.tvsdk.mediacore.BufferControlParameters" class .
If the exploit is successful , it will gain arbitrary read / write operations within memory , thus allowing it to execute a second stage shellcode .
The first stage shellcode contains an interesting NOP sled with alternative instructions , which was most likely designed in such a way to avoid detection by antivirus products looking for large NOP blocks inside flash files .
The main purpose of the initial shellcode is to download second stage shellcode from http://89.45.67.107/rss/5uzosoff0u.iaf .
The second stage shellcode will then perform the following actions : Download the final payload ( FinSpy ) from http://89.45.67.107/rss/mo.exe , Download a lure document to display to the victim from the same IP , Execute the payload and display the lure document .
As mentioned earlier , the "mo.exe" payload ( MD5: 4a49135d2ecc07085a8b7c5925a36c0a ) is the newest version of FinSpy malware , typically sold to nation states and other law enforcement agencies to use in lawful surveillance operations .
This newer variant has made it especially difficult for researchers to analyze the malware due to many added anti-analysis techniques , to include a custom packer and virtual machine to execute code .
The PCODE of the virtual machine is packed with the aplib packer .
After unpacking the virtual machine PCODE is then decrypted .
Once the payload is successfully executed , it will proceed to copy files to the following locations : C:\ProgramData\ManagerApp\AdapterTroubleshooter.exe , C:\ProgramData\ManagerApp\15b937.cab , C:\ProgramData\ManagerApp\install.cab , C:\ProgramData\ManagerApp\msvcr90.dll , C:\ProgramData\ManagerApp\d3d9.dll .
The "AdapterTroubleshooter.exe" file is a legitimate binary which is leveraged to use the famous DLL search order hijacking technique .
The "d3d9.dll" file is malicious and is loaded into memory by the legit binary upon execution .
Once loaded , the DLL will then inject FinSpy into the Winlogon process .
The payload calls out to three C2 servers for further control and exfiltration of data .
We have observed two of them used in the past with other FinSpy payloads .
Most recently one of these C2 servers was used together with CVE-2017-8759 in the attacks reported by FireEye in September 2017 .
These IPs and other previous samples tie closely to the BlackOasis APT cluster of FinSpy activity .
BlackOasis' interests span a wide gamut of figures involved in Middle Eastern politics and verticals disproportionately relevant to the region .
This includes prominent figures in the United Nations , opposition bloggers and activists , and regional news correspondents .
During 2016 , we observed a heavy interest in Angola , exemplified by lure documents indicating targets with suspected ties to oil , money laundering , and other illicit activities .
There is also an interest in international activists and think tanks .
Victims of BlackOasis have been observed in the following countries : Russia , Iraq , Afghanistan , Nigeria , Libya , Jordan , Tunisia , Saudi Arabia , Iran , Netherlands , Bahrain , United Kingdom and Angola .
We estimate that the attack on HackingTeam in mid-2015 left a gap on the market for surveillance tools , which is now being filled by other companies .
One of these is FinFisher with their suite of tools .
We believe the number of attacks relying on FinFisher software , supported by zero day exploits such as the ones described here will continue to grow .
What does it mean for everyone and how to defend against such attacks , including zero-day exploits?
For CVE-2017-11292 and other similar vulnerabilities , one can use the killbit for Flash within their organizations to disable it in any applications that respect it .
Unfortunately , doing this system-wide is not easily done , as Flash objects can be loaded in applications that potentially do not follow the killbit .
Additionally , this may break any other necessary resources that rely on Flash and of course , it will not protect against exploits for other third party software .
Deploying a multi-layered approach including access policies , anti-virus , network monitoring and whitelisting can help ensure customers are protected against threats such as this .
Users of Kaspersky products are protected as well against this threat by one of the following detections : PDM : Exploit.Win32.Generic , HEUR : Exploit.SWF.Generic , HEUR : Exploit.MSOffice.Generic .
