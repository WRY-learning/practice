MuddyWater is an APT with a focus on governmental and telco targets in the Middle East ( Iraq , Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Jordan , Turkey and Lebanon ) and also a few other countries in nearby regions ( Azerbaijan , Pakistan and Afghanistan ) .
MuddyWater first surfaced in 2017 and has been active continuously , targeting a large number of organizations .
First stage infections and graphical decoys have been described by multiple sources , including in our previous research :  “ MuddyWater expands operations “ .
Nevertheless , comprehensive details of what happens after the initial infection by MuddyWater have not previously been made publicly available .
MuddyWater attackers deploy a variety of tools and techniques , mostly developed by the group itself in Python , C# and PowerShell , to implement their attacks and complete their victim infiltration and data exfiltration .
Examples of such tools include multiple download/execute tools and RATs in C# and Python , SSH Python script , multiple Python tools for extraction of credentials , history and more .
This report details a collection of tools used by this threat actor on its targets after initial infection .
It also details deceptive techniques used to divert investigations once attack tools have been deployed inside victim systems ( such as Chinese strings , Russian strings and impersonation of the “ RXR Saudi Arabia ”  hacking group ) .
The investigation revealed additional OPSEC mistakes by the attackers , but we are not detailing those here due to ongoing law enforcement investigations .
During our research on MuddyWater campaigns , we were able to identify a number of tools and scripts used by this actor , providing a good understanding of this actor ’s abilities .
Most of the tools used are custom developed , while others are based on more generic and publicly available ones .
The list includes :
 Nihay – C# Download-and-Execute tool .
LisfonService – C# RAT .
Client.py – Python RAT .
Client-win.py – SSH Python script .
Rc.py/Rc.exe – Basic Python RAT .
VBScript and VBA files .
Third-party scripts ( Muddy , Losi Boomber , Slaver reverse tunnel … ) .
Second stage PowerShell scripts .
Most of these tools are scripts written in Python or PowerShell .
We noticed that MuddyWater compiles various offensive Python scripts into executables for portability , using Py2Exe and PyInstaller for this task .
This includes Python scripts such as “ CrackMapExec ”  , “ shootback ”  and “ Lazagne ”  .
We have also noticed the use of “ PS2EXE ”  to convert PowerShell scripts into executables , with the original PowerShell code embedded as a Base64-encoded string .
In other cases , we have noticed a preference for using PowerShell Reflective DLL injection to deploy Metasploit Stageless Meterpreters .
They use both 32-Bit and 64-Bit versions .
Usually , the Stageless Meterpreter has the “ Ext_server_stdapi.x64.dll ”  , “ Ext_server_extapi.x64.dll ”  , and “ Ext_server_espia.x64.dll ”  extensions .
LisfonService is a RAT very similar to the PowerShell RAT that we have analyzed in our previous publication .
LisfonService randomly chooses a URL from a huge array of hardcoded Proxy URLs hiding the real C2 server .
It collects some basic information about its victim : user name , domain or workgroup name , machine name , machine internal IP address , OS version , OS build and public IP address .
Once the victim is successfully registered , a victim id is assigned to the victim and is used later to request commands from the C2 , such as executing PowerShell code or causing a Blue Screen .
Inside the decompiled C# code , there is a referenced variable named “ str1 ”  that is not actually used .
We believe that it is a remnant from an earlier testing phase and it might be the IP address of the C2 behind the Proxy URLs .
str1 = " http://78.129.222.56:8090/244271232658346635408608084822345041494 " ;
 Client.Py is a Python 3.6 RAT that we believe was developed by MuddyWater .
It is deployed on victim computers as a compiled Python executable using PyInstaller .
The execution flow is as follows :
 Collects basic information about the victim machine :  machine name , OS name , OS version , and user name .
It then sends the information to the C2 server at 192.64.86.174:8980 .
It supports multiple commands , some of them executed by creating a temporary .VBS file and running it by calling cscript.exe .
The supported commands allow the RAT to implements basic keylogger functionality , stealing passwords saved in Chrome , killing task manager , remote command execution and displaying an alert message for the victim in a message box .
Client-win.py – SSH Python script .
This PyInstaller-compiled Python script makes use of the Python paramiko plugin to create a SSH connection to its C2 .
Connects to a hard-coded IP address for the C2 ( for instance 104.237.233.38 ) on port 8085 , sending the string “ ip ”  .
It should then receive a list of IPs in the form of “ ip1::ip2::ip3 ”  .
The script then connects to the same hard-coded IP address , sending the string “ pw ”  so that it gets a list of passwords from the C2 in the form of “ pw1\npw2\npw3 ”  .
Finally , it tries a list of hard-coded user names ( such as ‘ cisco ’  , ‘ root ’  , ‘ admin ’  ) with each of the passwords received on each of the IPs obtained in step 1 to authenticate SSH sessions .
Rc.py/Rc.exe – Basic Python RAT .
This UPX-packed executable is a PyInstaller-compiled Python script ( rc.py ) .
The script receives the IP address of its C2 as parameters , connecting to it on the hard-coded port 9095 .
This basic RAT supports a few commands on victims ’  systems to collect passwords and remote command execution .
“ kill ”  to self-terminate .
“ cd ”  for changing current directory .
“ dopass ”  for grabbing credentials from Chrome , IE ,  Mozilla , Opera and Outlook .
“ info ”  extracts basic info about victim machine :  OS name/version , 32-bit/64-bit , processor name , user name , machine name , machine FQDN , internal IP address , MAC address , and public IP address .
“ shell ”  receives files from C2 and saves them in “ C:\ProgramData ”  .
“ exec ”  spawns a new process as determined by C2 .
Otherwise , cmd.exe /c is called to spawn a new process as determined by C2 .
Output is always sent to C2 .
One of MuddyWater ’s preferred infection vectors is the use of weaponized macro-enabled Office 97-2003 Word documents .
Its malicious VBA code includes a Base64-encoded payload .
The first file is a malicious VBScript and the second file is the Base64-encoded payload .
The VBS calls powershell.exe to Base64-decode the second file and invoke it , as follows :
 We detected MuddyWater including several “ Lazagne “ -based scripts in its arsenal .
The first one , called Losi Boomber , is used to extract credentials and history from browsers and Outlook .
Muddy is another Lazagne-based script extracting credentials from mail clients and browsers .
In this case , it supports the following browsers :  Chrome , IE , Mozilla , Opera and Coccoc .
In terms of mail clients , it only supports Outlook .
Slaver.py is a compiled Python script taken from “ ShootBack ”  , used for establishing a reverse tcp tunnel .
Cr.exe is a compiled Python script based on CrackMapExec , used for credential gathering and lateral code execution .
Mmap.py ( called “ MapTools ”  by MuddyWaters ) is also based on CrackMapExec and used for the same purpose .
We detected MuddyWater making extensive use of PowerShell scripts for different purposes :
 Besides disabling PowerShell Script Block Logging and bypassing AMSI ( Anti-Malware Scan Interface ) , it fetches its next stage using the “ InternetExplorer.Application ”  COM object to retrieve HTML content from http://104.237.233.40:7070/admin/get.php .
Interestingly it uses a hard-coded CloudFlare HTTP header value :  “ CF-RAY :  oBLKRK3GNKZcBGZeWl+s4ExIaQ0= ”
 Case 2 :  We also identified MuddyWater ’s PowerShell prototype RAT implementing functions to collect user info ( internal IP address , user name , domain name , 32bit/64bit ) , RC4 encryption/decryption , Base64 encoding and decoding , changing cached group policy settings ( cachedGroupPolicySettings ) for PowerShell security settings , EnableScriptBlockLogging , EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging .
It also disables all HTTPS SSL certificate checks .
We have seen cases where the above was renamed to “ km ”  and directly invoked with its C2 IP set to “ 78.129.139.134 “ port “ 8080 ”  and RC4 key set to “ KharashoNIKharasho !
@#123456_6 ”  :
 We found an interesting case ( apparently exclusive to this actor ) of a WinRAR SFX ( self-extracting archive ) named “ Iranicard.exe ”  .
The embedded SFX pre-setup script is an MSHTA one-liner , which invokes a PowerShell one-liner that downloads and executes PowerShell code from ‘ https://dzoz.us/js/js.js ’  .
In our analysis of this actor ’s activities we have detected multiple OPSEC mistakes and analyzed some of the distraction techniques it has used .
Among the OPSEC mistakes , there were multiple PDB file paths left in some samples or in artifacts collected from the C2 server .
The .Net RAT called “ LisfonService ”  has PDB file paths referring to “ dragon ”  and “ Panda ”  as user names .
Panda and dragon could have been deliberately used to point researchers to a possible Chinese actor , or it may just be the way attackers like to refer to themselves .
It is worth mentioning that in some of the PowerShell RATs , attackers also used the “ $dragon_middle ”  variable name for an array of C2 proxy URLs .
Multiple weaponized Office Word documents also contain embedded paths from their authors ’  machines .
These paths are embedded by Office under various circumstances :  for instance , when somebody adds a binary object ( like an OLE control such as a text box or a command button ) into a Word document .
These PDBs provide the following usernames :  poopak , leo , Turk and Vendetta :
 Multiple Chinese strings can be found in some PowerShell RAT payloads ( such as Ffb8ea0347a3af3dd2ab1b4e5a1be18a ) that seem to have been left in on purpose , probably to make attribution harder .
In another PowerShell sample ( md5 :  e684aa1c6e51f4696a836ecb6ff1e143 , filename : km.ps1 ) , attackers used Russian words as the RC4 key when establishing a connection to the C2 server ( 78.129.139.134 ) .
Moreover , IP 78.129.139.134 is used as a C2 for other samples as well .
Interestingly , when visiting the C2 , it displays a blank webpage whose HTML source code shows a strange HTML tag value that suggests attackers have tried to impersonate a Saudi Hacking group called RXR Saudi Arabia .
MuddyWater attacks have been expanding in recent years in terms of targets and malware functionality .
The attackers seem to be reasonably well-equipped for their goals , with relatively simple and expendable tools to infiltrate victims and exfiltrate data , mostly using Python and PowerShell-based tools .
These tools also seem to allow them flexibility to adapt and customize the toolset for victims .
This continuous capability to steadily adjust and enhance attacks , adapting well to the changing Middle Eastern geopolitical scene , seems to make this actor a solid adversary that keeps growing .
We expect it to keep developing or acquiring additional tools and abilities , possibly including zero-days .
Nevertheless , its current OPSEC should be considered poor – for example , leaving details which could reveal different types of information about them .
