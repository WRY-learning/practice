In October 2018 , ESET published a report describing a set of activity they called GreyEnergy , which is believed to be a successor to BlackEnergy group .
BlackEnergy ( a.k.a .
Sandworm ) is best known , among other things , for having been involved in attacks against Ukrainian energy facilities in 2015 , which led to power outages .
Like its predecessor , GreyEnergy malware has been detected attacking industrial and ICS targets , mainly in Ukraine .
Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT has identified an overlap between GreyEnergy and a Sofacy subset called Zebrocy .
The Zebrocy activity was named after malware that Sofacy group began to use since mid-November 2015 for the post-exploitation stage of attacks on its victims .
Zebrocy's targets are widely spread across the Middle East , Europe and Asia and the targets' profiles are mostly government-related .
Both sets of activity used the same servers at the same time and targeted the same organization .
In our private APT Intel report from July 2018 Zebrocy implements new VBA anti-sandboxing tricks , details were provided about different Zebrocy C2 servers , including 193.23.181.151 .
In the course of our research , the following Zebrocy samples were found to use the same server to download additional components ( MD5 ) : 7f20f7fbce9deee893dbce1a1b62827d , 170d2721b91482e5cabf3d2fec091151 , eae0b8997c82ebd93e999d4ce14dedf5 , a5cbf5a131e84cd2c0a11fca5ddaa50a , c9e1b0628ac62e5cb01bf1fa30ac8317 .
The URL used to download additional data looks as follows : http://193.23.181.151/help-desk/remote-assistant-service/PostId.php?q={hex} .
This same C2 server was also used in a spearphishing email attachment sent by GreyEnergy ( aka FELIXROOT ) , as mentioned in a FireEye report .
Details on this attachment are as follows : 
The file ( 11227eca89cc053fb189fac3ebf27497 ) with the name Seminar.rtf exploited CVE-2017-0199 .
Seminar.rtf downloaded a second stage document from : http://193.23.181.151/Seminar.rtf ( 4de5adb865b5198b4f2593ad436fceff , exploiting CVE-2017-11882 ) .
The original document ( Seminar.rtf ) was hosted on the same server and downloaded by victims from : http://193.23.181.151/ministerstvo-energetiki/seminars/2019/06/Seminar.rtf .
Another server we detected that was used both by Zebrocy and by GreyEnergy is 185.217.0.124 .
Similarly , we detected a spearphishing GreyEnergy document ( a541295eca38eaa4fde122468d633083 , exploiting CVE-2017-11882 ) , also named Seminar.rtf .
This document downloads a GreyEnergy sample ( 78734cd268e5c9ab4184e1bbe21a6eb9 ) from the following SMB link : \\185.217.0.124\Doc\Seminar\Seminar_2018_1.AO-A .
The following Zebrocy samples use this server as C2: 7f20f7fbce9deee893dbce1a1b62827d , 170d2721b91482e5cabf3d2fec091151 , 3803af6700ff4f712cd698cee262d4ac , e3100228f90692a19f88d9acb620960d .
They retrieve additional data from the following URL : http://185.217.0.124/help-desk/remote-assistant-service/PostId.php?q={hex} .
It is worth noting that at least two samples from the above list use both 193.23.181.151 and 185.217.0.124 as C2s .
Additionally , both GreyEnergy and Zebrocy spearphishing documents targeted a number of industrial companies in Kazakhstan .
One of them was attacked in June 2018 .
A spearphishing document entitled 'Seminar.rtf' , which retrieved a GreyEnergy sample , was sent to the company approximately on June 21 , 2018 , followed by a Zebrocy spearphishing document sent approximately on June 28 .
The two C2 servers discussed above were actively used by Zebrocy and GreyEnergy almost at the same time : 193.23.181.151 was used by GreyEnergy and Zebrocy in June 2018 , 185.217.0.124 was used by GreyEnergy between May and June 2018 and by Zebrocy in June 2018 .
The GreyEnergy/BlackEnergy actor is an advanced group that possesses extensive knowledge on penetrating into their victim's networks and exploiting any vulnerabilities it finds .
This actor has demonstrated its ability to update its tools and infrastructure in order to avoid detection , tracking , and attribution .
Though no direct evidence exists on the origins of GreyEnergy , the links between a Sofacy subset known as Zebrocy and GreyEnergy suggest that these groups are related , as has been suggested before by some public analysis .
In this paper , we detailed how both groups shared the same C2 server infrastructure during a certain period of time and how they both targeted the same organization almost at the same time , which seems to confirm the relationship's existence .
