Operation AppleJeus : Lazarus hits cryptocurrency exchange with fake installer and macOS malware .
Release_Time :  2018-08-23 .
Report_URL :  https://securelist.com/operation-applejeus/87553/ .
Lazarus has been a major threat actor in the APT arena for several years .
Alongside goals like cyberespionage and cybersabotage , the attacker has been targeting banks and other financial companies around the globe .
Over the last few months , Lazarus has successfully compromised several banks and infiltrated a number of global cryptocurrency exchanges and fintech companies .
Kaspersky Lab has been assisting with incident response efforts .
While investigating a cryptocurrency exchange attacked by Lazarus , we made an unexpected discovery .
The victim had been infected with the help of a trojanized cryptocurrency trading application , which had been recommended to the company over email .
It turned out that an unsuspecting employee of the company had willingly downloaded a third-party application from a legitimate looking website and their computer had been infected with malware known as Fallchill , an old tool that Lazarus has recently switched back to .
There have been multiple reports on the reappearance of Fallchill , including one from US-CERT .
To ensure that the OS platform was not an obstacle to infecting targets , it seems the attackers went the extra mile and developed malware for other platforms , including for macOS .
A version for Linux is apparently coming soon , according to the website .
It ’s probably the first time we see this APT group using malware for macOS .
The fact that the Lazarus group has expanded its list of targeted operating systems should be a wake-up call for users of non-Windows platforms .
Thanks to Kaspersky Lab ’s malicious-behavior detection technology , implemented in its endpoint security software , we were able to reassemble the stages of infection and trace them back to their origin .
This helped us understand that one of Lazarus ’  victims was infected with malware after installing a cryptocurrency trading program .
We also confirmed that the user installed this program via a download link delivered over email .
Including malicious code into distributed software and putting that on a website would be too obvious .
Instead , the attackers went for a more elaborate scheme :  the trojan code was pushed out in the form of an update for a trading application .
A legitimate-looking application called Celas Trade Pro from Celas Limited showed no signs of malicious behaviour and looked genuine .
This application is an all-in-one style cryptocurrency trading program developed by Celas .
When we started this research , any user could download the trading application from the Celas website .
Checking the installation package downloaded from the website confirmed the presence of a very suspicious updater .
We have analyzed the following Windows version of the installation package :
 MD5 :  9e740241ca2acdc79f30ad2c3f50990a .
File name :  celastradepro_win_installer_1.00.00.msi .
File type :  MSI installer .
Creation time :  2018-06-29 01:16:00 UTC .
At the end of the installation process , the installer immediately runs the Updater.exe module with the “ CheckUpdate ”  parameter .
This file looks like a regular tool and most likely will not arouse the suspicion of system administrators .
After all , it even contains a valid digital signature , which belongs to the same vendor .
But the devil is in the detail , as usual .
The code writer developed this project under the codename “ jeus ”  , which was discovered in a PDB path included in the updater and used as unique HTTP multipart message data separator string .
Because of this , and the fact that the attacked platforms include Apple macOS , we decided to call this Operation AppleJeus .
Properties of the shady updater tool included in the package are :
 MD5 :  b054a7382adf6b774b15f52d971f3799 .
File Type :  PE32 executable ( GUI ) Intel 80386 , for MS Windows .
Known file name :  %Program Files%\CelasTradePro\Updater.exe .
Link Time :  2018-06-15 10:56:27 UTC .
Build path :  Z:\jeus\downloader\downloader_exe_vs2010\Release\dloader.pdb .
The main purpose of Updater.exe is to collect the victim ’s host information and send it back to the server .
Upon launch , the malware creates a unique string with the format string template “ %09d-%05d ”  based on random values , which is used as a unique identifier of the infected host .
This malware collects process lists , excluding “ [ System Process ] ”  and “ System ”  processes and gets the exact OS version from the registry value at “ HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion ”  .
It seems that such values only exist from Windows 10 , so we assume that the author developed and tested it on Windows 10 .
ProductName :  Windows OS version .
CurrentBuildNumber :  Windows 10 build version .
ReleaseID :  Windows 10 version information .
UBR :  Sub version of Windows 10 build .
BuildBranch :  Windows 10 build branch information .
The code encrypts the collected information with the hardcoded XOR key ( “ Moz&Wie ; #t/6T!2y “ ) before uploading it to the server .
The code sends the victim ’s information to a webserver using HTTP and the following URL : www.celasllc.com / checkupdate.php .
The server is a legitimate looking website owned by the developer of the program :  Celas LLC .
At this point we were not able to conclude with high confidence whether the server was compromised by the threat actor or had belonged to the threat actor from the beginning .
To learn more about the server , please read the “ Infrastructure ”  section below .
The malware used a hardcoded User-Agent string “ Mozilla/5.0 ( compatible ;  MSIE 10.0 ;  Windows NT 6.1 ;  Trident/6.0 ) ”  and fixed a multipart form data separator string “ jeus “ .
Using encryption , the custom separator string wouldn ’t be a red flag for a legitimate application , but sending a request with the context-irrelevant string “ get_config ”  , as well as uploading collected system information as “ temp.gif ”  , mimicking a GIF image with a magic number in the header , definitely made us raise our eyebrows .
After successfully uploading data , the updater checks the server response .
If the server responds with HTTP code 300 , it means the updater should keep quiet and take no action .
However , if the response is HTTP code 200 , it extracts the payload with base64 and decrypts it using RC4 with another hardcoded key ( “ W29ab@ad%Df324V$Yd “ ) .
The decrypted data is an executable file that is prepended with the “ MAX_PATHjeusD ”  string .
During our research , we found other similar files .
One was created on August 3rd and another on August 11th .
The PDB path shows that the author keeps improving this updater tool , apparently forked from some stable version released on July 2 , 2018 according to the internal directory name .

H:\DEV\TManager\DLoader\20180702\dloader\WorkingDir\Output\00000009\Release\dloader.pdb H:\DEV\TManager\DLoader\20180702\dloader\WorkingDir\Output\00000006\Release\dloader.pdb .
Note the TManager directory in the PDB path from the table .
It will pop up again in another unexpected place later .
For macOS users , Celas LLC also provided a native version of its trading app .
A hidden “ autoupdater ”  module is installed in the background to start immediately after installation , and after each system reboot .
It keeps contacting the command and control ( C2 ) server in order to download and run an additional executable from the server .
The communication conforms to the Windows version of the updater and is disguised as an image file upload and download , while carrying encrypted data inside .
We have analyzed the following installation file :
MD5 :  48ded52752de9f9b73c6bf9ae81cb429 .
File Size :  15,020,544 bytes .
File Type :  DMG disk image .
Known file name :  celastradepro_mac_installer_1.00.00.dmg .
Date of creation :  13 July 2018 .
Once the Cellas Trade Pro app is installed on macOS , it starts the Updater application on the system load via a file named “ .com.celastradepro.plist ”  ( note that it starts with a dot symbol , which makes it unlisted in the Finder app or default Terminal directory listing ) .
The “ Updater ”  file is passed the “ CheckUpdate ”  parameter on start .
The command-line argument “ CheckUpdate ”  looks redundant from a code analysis perspective :  there is no other argument that the application expects .
In the absence of all arguments , it doesn ’t do anything and quits .
This may or may not be way to trick sandboxes that could automatically execute this trojan updater , with no suspicious activity produced without such a “ secret ”  extra argument .
The choice of a benign string such as “ CheckUpdate ”  helps it to hide in plain sight of any user or administrator looking into running processes .
The trojanized updater works similar to the Windows version in many ways .
Both applications are implemented using a cross-platform QT framework .
Upon launch , the downloader creates a unique identifier for the infected host using a “ %09d-%06d ”  format string template .
Next , the app collects basic system information , which for macOS is done via dedicated QT classes : Host name , OS type and version , System architecture , OS kernel type and version .
The process of encrypting and transferring data is the same as in the Windows version .
This information is XOR-encrypted with hardcoded 16-byte static key “ Moz&Wie ; #t/6T!2y ”  , prepended with GIF89a header and uploaded to the C2 server via HTTP POST and the following URL : https://www.celasllc.com/checkupdate.php .
The module relies on a hardcoded User-Agent string for macOS :
 User-Agent :  Mozilla/5.0 ( Macintosh ;  Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6 ) AppleWebKit/537.36  ( KHTML , like Gecko ) Chrome/66.0.3359.139 Safari/537.36 .
Once the server replies , it checks the HTTP response code .
HTTP response code 300 indicates that the server has no task for the updater and the application terminates immediately .
If the HTTP response is code 200 , then the updater gets the data in the response , decodes it from base64 encoding and decrypts it using RC4 with the hardcoded static key “ W29ab@ad%Df324V$Yd “ .
It calculates the MD5 of the decoded and decrypted data , which is compared to a value stored inside , to verify the integrity of the transferred file .
After that , the payload is extracted and saved to a hardcoded file location “ /var/zdiffsec “ , sets executable permissions for all users and starts the app with another secret hardcoded command-line argument “ bf6a0c760cc642 “ .
Apparently the command-line argument is the way to prevent the detection of its malicious functionality via sandboxes or even reverse engineering .
We have previously seen this technique adopted by Lazarus group in 2016 in attacks against banks .
As of 2018 , it is still using this in almost every attack we investigated .
According to data from Kaspersky Security Network , the threat actor delivered the malicious payload using one of the shadowy updaters described above .
We found a malicious file created at the same host :
MD5 :  0a15a33844c9df11f12a4889ae7b7e4b .
File Size :  104,898,560 bytes .
File Type :  PE32+ executable ( GUI ) x86-64 , for MS Windows .
Known file name :  C:\Recovery\msn.exe .
Link time :  2018-04-19 13:30:19 .
Note the unusually large size for an executable file .
We believe that it was inflated with junk data on purpose to prevent easy download or transfer over the internet .
Searching for the reason for the malware ’s appearance on the system revealed that there was an additional process responsible for producing several files before this malware was launched , suggesting a trojan dropper in action .
The main function of this malware is to implant the Fallchill backdoor loader linked to several files .
Upon launch , the malware checks one of the command-line arguments passed to it .
The malware chooses one of the service names located in the following registry value as a disguise :
 HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost\netsvcs .
This value includes a list of several dozen standard system service names .
The randomly chosen service name is used to name the dropped file and newly registered Windows service .
Let ’s refer to this randomly chosen service name as [ service ] .
The malware contains references to several files inside :
 The file passed as argument : contains a 16-byte key .
msncf.dat :  Encrypted configuration data .
msndll.tmp :  Encrypted Fallchill loader .
msndll.dat :  Encrypted Fallchill backdoor ( payload for the loader ) .
[service]svc.dll :  Fallchill backdoor loader .
[service].dat :  Copy of msndll.dat .
A mix of the above-mentioned files produces the final backdoor known as Fallchill .
A more detailed procedure for technical specialists is as follows :
 Check whether the command-line argument points to a file of 16 byte size .
Read the file passed via the command-line argument .
The contents of this file contains a crypto key , which we will call the main key .
Open the msncf.dat file ( configuration file ) .
If the file size equals 192 bytes , read the content of the file .
Open msndll.tmp file and decrypt it using the main key .
Create the [service]svc.dll file and fill it with pseudo-random data .
The malware fills the file with 10,240 bytes of pseudo-random data , and iterates ( rand() % 10 + 10240 ) times .
This is why it produces files which are at least 104,851,000 bytes .
Copy the 16-byte main key at the end of the [service]svc.dll file .
Encrypt the [service].dat file name with the main key and append it at the end of [service]svc.dll .
Overwrite the beginning of [service]svc.dll with data decrypted from msndll.tmp .
Move msndll.dat file to [service].dat .
Delete temporary files : msndll.tmp , msncf.dat , msndll.log .
Timestamp [service]svc.dll and [service].dat files .
Register [service]svc.dll as a Windows service .
Save a copy of data from msncf.dat file in the following registry value
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\TaskConfigs\Description .
We confirmed that the following malware was created on the infected host using the method described above :
 Fallchill backdoor loader :
 MD5 :  e1ed584a672cab33af29114576ad6cce .
File Size :  104,878,356 bytes .
File Type :  PE32+ executable ( DLL ) ( console ) x86-64 , for MS Windows .
Known file name :  C:\Windows\system32\uploadmgrsvc.dll .
Link time :  2018-01-18 01:56:32 .
Encrypted Fallchill backdoor :  
MD5 :  d8484469587756ce0d10a09027044808 .
File Size :  143,872 bytes .
File Type :  encrypted data .
Known file name :  C:\Windows\system32\uploadmgr.dat .
Upon starting , uploadmgrsvc.dll reads 276 bytes from the end of its own executable file .
The first 16 bytes of this 276-byte data are used as a decryption key , and the remaining 260 bytes contain the encrypted file path used by the backdoor .
After decryption of the last 260-bytes , the malware retrieves the name or path of the file that contains the actual backdoor body in encrypted form .
The malware reads the specified file and decrypts it using the same decryption routine .
This is how the executable code of the backdoor is produced in memory and executed by the loader .
Below is the meta information about the decrypted final payload in memory :
 MD5 :  d7089e6bc8bd137a7241a7ad297f975d .
File Size :  143,872 bytes .
File Type :  PE32+ executable ( DLL ) ( GUI ) x86-64 , for MS Windows .
Link Time :  2018-03-16 07:15:31 .
We can summarize the Fallchill backdoor loading process as follows :
 As mentioned previously , the final payload belongs to a Fallchill malware cluster formerly attributed to the Lazarus APT group .
Upon launching , this malware resolves the API function addresses at runtime , and reads the C2 server address from the registry value created during the installation stage :
 HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\TaskConfigs\Description .
If there is no configuration value , the malware falls back to a default C2 server address .
196.38.48.121 .
185.142.236.226 .
This is a full-featured backdoor that contains enough functions to fully control the infected host .
Some of its network protocol commands are described below .
This set of capabilities is very common for many Lazarus backdoors , which have been seen in other attacks against banks and financial industry in the past years .
While working on the incident of the cryptocurrency company ’s breach , we were curious about the legal status of the Celas LLC company that developed this trojanized trading application .
The website had a valid SSL certificate issued by Comodo CA .
However , note that the certificate from this webserver mentions “ Domain Control Validated ”  , which is a weak security verification level for a webserver .
It does not mean validation of the identity of the website ’s owner , nor of the actual existence of the business .
When certification authorities issue this kind of certificate they only check that the owner has a certain control over the domain name , which can be abused in certain ways .
Below is the WHOIS record of the “ celasllc.com ”  domain .
The domain name was registered by an individual named “ John Broox ”  with registrant email address “ johnbroox200@gmail.com ”  .
The same name of “ John Broox ”  was used inside the installation package of the macOS version of the trading application .
The Info.plist properties file describes the package as follows :
 It looks at first sight like a legitimate WHOIS record , but something doesn ’t really add up here .
The domain celasllc.com was the only domain registered with this email address and was exclusively used for domain registration .
The registrant used the Domain4Bitcoins service to register this domain , apparently paying with cryptocurrency .
According to open-source intelligence , the address of the WHOIS information is fake , unless it ’s the owner of a ramen shop running a cryptocurrency exchange software development studio on the side .
The server hosting celasllc.com ( 185.142.236.213 ) belongs to the Blackhost ISP in the Netherlands .
Coincidentally , the Fallchill malware authors also preferred to use the same hosting company to host their C2 server .
Moreover , the Celas LLC web server and one of the C2 servers of the Fallchill malware are located in the same network segment of this ISP :
 Celas LLC infrastructure :  
185.142.236.213 :  Netherlands Blackhost Ltd. AS174 COGENT-174 .
Fallchill malware C2 server :  
196.38.48.121 :  South Africa Internet Solutions AS3741 .
185.142.236.226 :  Netherlands Blackhost Ltd. AS174 COGENT-174 .
Additional attacker ’s server from telemetry .
80.82.64.91 :  Seychelles Incrediserve Ltd AS29073 .
185.142.239.173 :  Netherlands Blackhost Ltd. AS174 COGENT-174 .
However , when you look into Celas Trading Pro application ’s digital signature , including its “ Updater ”  , you will find that this certificate was also issued by Comodo CA , which refers to a company address in the United States .
According to open-source data , this address doesn ’t belong to a real business , and looks on maps like a meadow with a small forest and small real estate offering nearby .
Pivoting the infrastructure a little further brings up some more suspicious things .
It appears that the domain referred to two IPs , one of which was linked to a few other suspicious domains , according to PassiveDNS .
The owners of the linked infrastructural elements preferred to use several interesting services for hosting domain registration .
All these service providers offer a certain level of anonymity to their customers .
Most of them accept Bitcoins as a main payment method to keep their customers anonymous .
This is very uncommon for companies running a legitimate business .
Hosting services linked to Celas LLC :
 Blackhost ( https://black.host/ ) .
Liberty VPS  ( https://libertyvps.net/ ) .
Domain registration services linked to Celas LLC :
Domains4Bitcoins ( https://www.domains4bitcoins.com/ ) .
NameCheap ( https://www.namecheap.com/ ) .
ChangeIP ( https://www.changeip.com / ) .
Njalla ( https://njal.la/ ) .
All the facts above can make the more sceptical among us doubt the intentions of Celas LLC and the legitimacy of this business .
Of course , these facts alone would not be enough to accuse Celas LLC of committing a crime .
Kaspersky Lab has previously attributed the Fallchill malware cluster to Lazarus group when it attacked the financial sector around the world .
It was also confirmed by other security vendors , and the national CERT of US .
Fallchill malware uses a RC4 algorithm with a 16-byte key to protect its communications .
The key extracted from the Fallchill variant used in the current attack is DA E1 61 FF 0C 27 95 87 17 57 A4 D6 EA E3 82 2B .
We were able to confirm that some of older Fallchill malware variants used exactly the same RC4 key .
Below are Fallchill malware samples that used the same key ( the compilation timestamp may indicate the date of malware creation ) .

cd6796f324ecb7cf34bc9bc38ce4e649 2016-04-17 03:26:56 .
We have confirmed that the C2 server addresses ( 196.38.48.121 , 185.142.236.226 ) used in this attack have been used by the older variant of Fallchill .
94dfcabd8ba5ca94828cd5a88d6ed488 2016-10-24 02:31:18 .

abec84286df80704b823e698199d89f7 2017-01-18 04:29:29 .
Apparently , the attackers using the Fallchill malware continue to reuse code and C2 server infrastructure over and over again .
According to Kaspersky Security Network , Fallchill was not the only malware used in this attack .
There was another backdoor that was used by the threat actor .
We omit a full description of this backdoor in the current report to keep the write-up to an acceptable length , but we would like to highlight two important things discovered in it .
First , this backdoor was created on 2018-07-12 and revealed an already familiar directory , “ TManager ”  , which we previously saw in the Updater.exe application from the Cellas Trading Pro suite :
 H:\DEV\TManager\all_BOSS_troy\T_4.2\T_4.2\Server_\x64\Release\ServerDll.pdb .
Second , what is probably one of the most interesting findings to come from this additional backdoor was discovered hidden in hardcoded headers used to communicate with C2 server .
The Accept-Language HTTP header string revealed a language code associated with North Korea .
In our experience , this is something we normally don ’t see in malware .
Accept-Language :  ko-kp ,ko-kr ; q=0.8 ,ko ; q=0.6 ,en-us ; q=0.4 ,en ; q=0.2 .
The Lazarus APT group ’s continuous attacks on the financial sector are not much of a surprise to anyone .
A lot of research has been done and published about such attacks .
However , we think this case makes a difference .
Recent investigation shows how aggressive the group is and how its strategies may evolve in the future .
First of all , Lazarus group has entered a new platform :  macOS .
There is steadily growing interest in macOS from ordinary users , especially in IT companies .
Many developers and engineers are switching to using macOS .
Apparently , in the chase after advanced users , software developers from supply chains and some high profile targets , threat actors are forced to have macOS malware tools .
We believe that in the future Lazarus is going to support all platforms that software developers are using as a base platform , because compromising developers opens many doors at once .
We cannot say with full certainty whether Celas LLC was compromised and the threat actor abused it to push malware through an update mechanism .
However , the multiple successful Lazarus attempts to compromise supply chain companies suggest that it will keep exploring this infection method .
From all angles , the Celas LLC story looks like the threat actor has found an elaborate way to create a legitimate looking business and inject a malicious payload into a “ legitimate looking ”  software update mechanism .
Sounds logical :  if one cannot compromise a supply chain , why not to make fake one ?
This should be a lesson to all of us and a wake-up call to businesses relying on third-party software .
Do not automatically trust the code running on your systems .
Neither good looking website , nor solid company profile nor the digital certificates guarantee the absence of backdoors .
Trust has to be earned and proven .
Stay safe !
