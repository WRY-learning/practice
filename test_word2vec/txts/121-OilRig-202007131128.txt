Unit 42 has discovered activity involving threat actors responsible for the OilRig campaign with a potential link to a threat group known as GreenBug .
Symantec first reported on this group back in January 2017 , detailing their operations and using a custom information stealing Trojan called ISMDoor .
In July 2017 , we observed an attack on a Middle Eastern technology organization that was also targeted by the OilRig campaign in August 2016 .
Initial inspection of this attack suggested this was again the OilRig campaign using their existing toolset , but further examination revealed not only new variants of the delivery document we named Clayslide , but also a different payload embedded inside it .
In the past , we had primarily associated the OilRig campaign with using the Clayslide documents to deliver as a payload a Trojan we named Helminth ; in this instance , the payload was instead a variant of the ISMDoor Trojan with significant modifications which we are now tracking as ISMAgent .
On July 16 , 2017 , actors associated with the OilRig campaign sent emails to five different individuals within the targeted organization .
All of the emails sent had the same subject , attachment filename , and attached Excel file ( SHA256: 3eb14b6705179590f0476d3d3cbd71665e7c1935ecac3df7b876edc9bd7641b6 ) .
We identified the Excel file attached to the delivery email as a variant of the Clayslide delivery documents used by the OilRig campaign .
A closer look revealed that although it was similar to previous Clayslide documents , it was also quite different in several aspects .
Like the previous samples , it displays a worksheet titled “ Incompatible ” containing a banner that shows a fake compatibility warning message .
The message is an attempt to trick the user into clicking the “ Enable Content ” button , which would run a malicious macro embedded within the Excel file .
The macro within the delivery document will unhide and display a new worksheet that contains a fake invoice for Citrix products .
This fake invoice acts as a decoy document to minimize the user ’s suspicions that any malicious activity occurred .
While the macro displays the decoy invoice spreadsheet , it silently runs malicious code in the background to install its payload .
The malicious code starts by concatenating several base64 encoded strings into a single variable .
As you can see in the following code snippet , the variable name “ Paltofp1 ” suggests that the author of this code may want our attention .
The macro then writes the concatenated base64 encoded data to the file %PUBLIC%\Libraries\B642.txt .
It then reads in the “ B642.txt ” file and decodes the data , which it will save to the file %PUBLIC%\Libraries\servicereset.exe ( SHA256: 52366b9ab2eb1d77ca6719a40f4779eb302dca97a832bd447abf10512dc51ed9 ) .
The servicereset.exe file is the payload of this attack , which is a variant of ISMDoor that we track as ISMAgent .
The script then creates a file named %PUBLIC%\Libraries\OfficeServicesStatus.vbs which contains a VBScript that will execute the “ servicereset.exe ” file using the command line .
Lastly , as a persistence mechanism , a scheduled task named “ OfficeServicesStatus ” will be created , set to run every three minutes .
While hunting for other samples similar to the one observed in the attack against the technology organization , we discovered yet another variant of Clayslide ( SHA256: 5ac939a5426db8614165bd8b6a02d3e8d9f167379c6ed28025bf3b37f1aea902 ) .
This sample was dated June 2017 , a month older than the newest version containing ISMAgent .
Based upon timestamping and similarities with both the original Clayslide documents as well as the newest ISMAgent loaded ones , we believe this June 2016 sample to be an iterative version of Clayslide .
The June 2017 sample of Clayslide contained the same OfficeServicesStatus.vbs file found in the ISMAgent Clayslide document , but instead of having the payload embedded in the macro as segregated base64 strings that would be concatenated , this variant obtained its payload from multiple cells within the “ Incompatible ” worksheet .
This technique was observed in previous Clayslide documents to access the script variant of the Helminth Trojan in earlier OilRig attacks .
Also , the June 2017 sample contained artifacts observed in previous Clayslide documents as documented in a blog post we published in April .
Although structurally the document was more similar to the originally discovered Clayslide documents , this June 2017 sample was designed to load ISMAgent instead of Helminth .
We do not have targeting details for this sample , although the decoy document contained a similar theme to the newest Clayslide document , displaying vendor related information .
The payload ( SHA256: 52366b9ab2eb1d77ca6719a40f4779eb302dca97a832bd447abf10512dc51ed9 ) delivered in the June 2016 attack is a variant of the recent ISMDoor versions that use DNS tunneling for its C2 communications .
On May 1 , 2017 , Arbor Networks published research on ISMDoor using DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server , which is nearly identical to the DNS tunneling the payload of this attack carries out .
Due to considerable differences and evidence of potentially different authors between the previous ISMDoor samples and this newly discovered variant , we are tracking this new variant as ISMAgent .
The ISMAgent tool comes with a default configuration that specifies the C2 domain and the number of minutes between further attempts to execute the tool .
However , an actor can use command line arguments to create a new ISMAgent sample that is configured with a specified C2 domain and a specified number of minutes to automatically execute the Trojan .
If the Trojan is executed with these arguments , the Trojan will read its own file data in , and search for two strings of characters within the data that it will overwrite with the configured settings .
The Trojan searches for a string of “ ^ ” characters that it will overwrite with the C2 domain provided via the “ -c ” argument , and it searches for the string “ %%%% ” that it will replace with the number of minutes provided via the “ -m ” argument .
The “ %%%% ” string exists within the following larger string , that the Trojan uses as a command to execute in order to create a scheduled task named “ TimeUpdate ” to execute the payload after the specified number of minutes passes .
The Trojan is able to use two mechanisms to communicate with its C2 server : HTTP requests and DNS tunneling .
The DNS tunneling protocol found in this payload is remarkably similar to recent ISMDoor samples , as documented in Arbor Networks ’ research .
Similar message handling is found in both ISMAgent and ISMDoor , in addition to the existence of strings in both samples , such the hardcoded IPv6 values .
The similarities may allow for backward compatibility between ISMAgent and ISMDoor C2 infrastructure .
In the payloads themselves , a number of differences exist , enough that in essence they appear to be different tools .
Regardless of the communications method used , the Trojan will parse the received data from the C2 server for a GUID field that the Trojan will use as a unique identifier , as well as commands the Trojan should run on the compromised system .
ISMAgent prioritizes HTTP as its mechanism to communicate with the C2 server , but if it is unable to reach the C2 server it will switch to the DNS tunneling mechanism .
To carry out its HTTP C2 communications , the Trojan prepends “ www. ” to the configured C2 domain and issues a DNS query to resolve this domain .
The Trojan will use the resolved IP address as the host in the HTTP beacon request .
For instance , the sample used in this attack was configured to use ntpupdateserver.com for its C2 server .
The HTTP C2 process would attempt to resolve the domain “ www.ntpupdateserver.com ” , which resolved to 142.54.179.90 , so the Trojan would use the string “ http : /w ” as the basis of the C2 URL .
The C2 server will respond to this request with a command string using the previously mentioned format .
If the C2 server provides a command to execute on the system , the Trojan executes it using cmd.exe and writes the output to %TEMP%\runlog[random number].tmp .
The Trojan will read this runlog file and send it to the C2 server via an HTTP POST request to a URL .
The HTTP POST request contains an anomalous boundary value of “ myboundary ” and hardcoded filename value of “ a.a ” .
While we did not observe the C2 server attempting to run additional commands via ISMAgent , we were able to analyze the Trojan itself to determine the functionality of its available commands .
If the command string contains a URL to download a file to the system , the Trojan will simply use the URLDownloadToFileA function to download and save the file to the target system in the %TEMP% folder .
If the C2 server provides a path to a file it wishes to upload from the system , the Trojan will open the file , read its contents , and then upload its contents via an HTTP POST to the following URL .
ISMAgent uses its DNS tunneling technique for C2 as a backup to its HTTP capability .
This mechanism supports the same command message structure and even handles the commands in the same manner .
The Trojan sends data to the C2 server via DNS queries by encoding data and using the encoded string as a subdomain of an actor owned domain .
The C2 server can send data to the Trojan by resolving the DNS queries to IPv6 addresses that the Trojan treats as hexadecimal data .
To carry out its DNS C2 communications , the Trojan will issue DNS queries to the C2 domain to obtain the AAAA records associated with the domain .
The Trojan starts this process by creating a unique GUID and appending it to the string “ n.n.c. ” to create a subdomain to query in the following format .
To respond to this beacon , the C2 domain ’s name server will respond to this query with a hardcoded IPv6 value of a67d : 0db8:a2a1:7334:7654:4325:0370:2aa3 .
This value acts as an acknowledgement of the beacon .
The Trojan will then base64 encode the HTTP C2 URL it was using and will send this data to the C2 by constructing and issuing the following DNS query .
The Trojan splits up the base64 encoded data across several DNS queries , which we believe the C2 domain ’s name server pieces together using the supplied sequence numbers .
The name server will respond to each of these DNS queries with another hardcoded IPv6 value of a67d : 0db8:85a3:4325:7654:8a2a : 0370:7334 to notify the Trojan that it has received the data .
After all of the data is successfully sent via DNS requests , the Trojan will send a final DNS query that has the following structure to notify the C2 server that it has completed its data transfer .
After notifying the C2 server that the data transfer has completed , the Trojan may issue additional DNS queries to notify it is ready to receive data back from the C2 server using the following domain name structure .
The DNS server will then respond to these DNS queries with additional IPv6 addresses that the Trojan will treat as hexadecimal data as described by Arbor Networks .
The ISMAgent payload embedded inside the newest variant of Clayslide used the C2 domain ntpupdateserver.com .
The primary second-level domain has no IP resolution , instead relying on www.ntpupdateserver.com for resolution then two specific subdomains of ns1.ntupdateserver.com and ns2.ntpupdateserver.com as the actual DNS C2 handler .
The ISMAgent payload embedded inside the June version used a completely different C2 domain at Microsoft-publisher.com , but used the exact same domain name structure .
Lastly , we were able to identify a third sample of ISMAgent leveraging another unique C2 domain , adobeproduct.com .
Pivoting from the WHOIS registrant email address of paul.mcalister[at]mail.com revealed four additional highly suspect domains .
Pivoting on the WHOIS phone number we found two additional domains .
These are registered with the same Registrar , have the same WHOIS address , but the registrant name “ bolips Angelio ” and email address bolips[at]outlook.com .
Thematically , these domains follow the pattern of ISMAgent and OilRig C2 domain names , abusing typo-squatting techniques in attempts to appear as legitimate domains .
Each of these additional domains had the same structure as the three ISMAgent C2 domains , with no IP resolution on the primary second-level domain containing the www , ns1 , and ns2 subdomains .
Based off the same registrant email address and domain name structure , it is highly probable these other domains are also part of the ISMAgent infrastructure as C2 servers .
Lastly , we identified another ISMAgent sample using the C2 domain of adobeproduct.com , which again fits thematically and was also found to have the www , ns1 , and ns2 subdomains attached to it .
On the surface , the ISMAgent payload appears similar to the ISMDoor payload , sharing functionality such as a specific DNS tunneling protocol .
However , closer analysis shows there are enough differences between the two payloads that justifies tracking ISMAgent as its own tool with its own name .
First , all known ISMDoor payloads using DNS tunneling were created for 64-bit architectures , while all known ISMAgent are x86 only .
The most recent ISMDoor payloads using DNS tunneling have abandoned HTTP as a C2 communications method compared to earlier ISMDoor samples , whereas ISMAgent uses HTTP as the primary method and DNS tunneling as a secondary method to communicate with its C2 server .
Also , while the DNS tunneling protocol is the same , the messages within the transmitted encoded data differs dramatically .
After the initial “ n.n.c. ” beacon , ISMAgent sends the HTTP C2 URL as the data via the DNS tunneling protocol to send a beacon to its C2 .
During our analysis , we observed the sample used in this attack sending the following data immediately after the initial beacon .
Comparatively , ISMDoor sends a much more involved series of messages to the C2 server in order to get a command .
The following is a sequence of messages sent from the ISMDoor Trojan to its C2 server via the DNS tunneling protocol , the last message ( “ M : GAC? ” ) resulting in a command for the Trojan to run .
Lastly , the commands available within ISMAgent and ISMDoor are very different .
As mentioned previously , ISMAgent has a far more limited , but flexible command set , allowing an adversary to upload and download files , in addition to command execution via command prompt .
The most recent version of ISMDoor ( v 10.0.192 SHA256: aa52dcaf6df43c6aa872fe0f73725f61e082d32c33fc976741d4eca17679533d ) on the other hand , has a more comprehensive yet more rigid command set .
During our data collection process , we discovered a Clayslide delivery document ( SHA256: ca8cec08b4c74cf68c71a39176bfc8ee1ae4372f98f75c892706b2648b1e7530 ) from September 2016 containing a payload that appeared to be the Helminth script variant as found in other Clayslide documents , but upon further examination was wholly different .
The macro within this Clayslide documents obtains a PowerShell script from a cell in the “ Incompatible ” worksheet , much like previous samples .
The macro then saves a VBScript to %PUBLIC%\Libraries\LicenseCheck.vbs to run this PowerShell script every 3 minutes .
Like the Helminth script variants , this PowerShell script is a malicious payload that uses both HTTP requests and DNS tunneling to interact with its C2 server .
However , the HTTP requests and the protocol employed to perform DNS tunneling differs dramatically from Helminth scripts installed by all other known Clayslide samples .
The HTTP requests and DNS tunneling protocol found in this PowerShell script are instead identical to ISMAgent .
The C2 domain used for this script was mslicensecheck.com , which had previously been reported by LogRhythm in their OilRig whitepaper .
Interestingly , it was the only domain associated with OilRig that did not have an IP resolution at its second-level , much like the ISMAgent samples .
The “ doIt ” function within the PowerShell script , seen in Figure 7 , is responsible for initiating the C2 communications , as well as parsing the data provided by the C2 server to run the appropriate commands .
This function uses the strings “ /action2/ ” , “ /response/ ” and “ /upload/ ” within the C2 URLs when using HTTP to communicate with the C2 server .
This behavior and these strings were also observed in the ISMAgent C2 behavior .
The “ doIt ” function also shows that the C2 server will respond with data structured the same way as ISMAgent , using “ # ” as a delimiter and various offsets such as offset 0 used in subsequent requests with the C2 , offset 2 specifying a URL to download a file from , offset 3 specifying a command to execute using command-prompt , and offset 4 specifying a path to a file to upload to the C2 server .
The commonalities between this PowerShell script and ISMAgent do not stop there .
The HTTP requests to the C2 server use the exact same URL structure .
For instance , the payload generates a URL using the following line of code , which results in a base64 encoded string that contains [hostname/username] .
Also , as seen in the code above , the PowerShell script makes sure the base64 encoded data used is safe to use in an HTTP URL , by replacing the characters “ = ” , “ / ” and “ + ” characters with hexadecimal equivalent .
The ISMAgent payloads also performed the exact same replacement .
The DNS tunneling protocol within the PowerShell script is the same as the ISMAgent payload , which can be visualized by the following beacon sent from the PowerShell script .
To facilitate the DNS tunneling functionality , the PowerShell script replaces the “ = ” , “ / ” and “ + ” characters within the base64 data sent to the C2 server within the subdomains of DNS queries .
However , DNS queries cannot include the “ % ” character , so it uses the following line of code to replace them with “ - “ , “ -s- “ and “ -p- “ instead .
The OilRig campaign has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness and desire to be iterative in their toolset , while maintaining some level of similarities over time .
In this scenario , we were able to directly observe this type of behavior , while also implement a tool thought to be previously unrelated to OilRig .
With the inclusion of ISMAgent within the OilRig toolset , we are beginning to see stronger relationships between the various documented groups operating in the Middle East .
This region has proven to be a hot bed of espionage motivated activity over the last couple of years , and there appear to be no signs of this changing .
As our research continues , our goal will be to generate even better understandings of the true extent of the various operations in this region and the relationships between them .
