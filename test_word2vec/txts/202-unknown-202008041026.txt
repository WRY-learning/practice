Release_Time :  2020-3-24 .
Report_URL :  https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/covid19-cyber-threats/ .
When people ask me what Unit 42 does , the most concise answer I can normally give is “ we research bad guys doing bad things .
 ” With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic spreading around the world , many of us have had to adapt our lives to accommodate the new reality .
Bad guys are no different .
They ’  ve also adapted and are taking advantage of this pandemic to launch cyber attacks .
The biggest opportunity for cyber attackers with this outbreak has nothing to do with technology , but with how humans change their behavior and patterns in response to the crisis .
The purpose of this report is not to contribute to the fear and anxiety many of us are already experiencing , but to help you be informed about what is happening and how to protect yourself and your organization .
We will update this blog as new information comes to light .
As with other high-profile events , attackers are taking advantage of the high amount of attention paid to COVID-19 to lure victims into opening attachments on malicious emails and click on phishing links .
This is not a single attack or event campaign , but a widespread use of virus related themes .
We ’  ve identified malicious emails using subjects containing COVID-19 and related keywords carrying Remote Administration Tools ( RATs ) like NetWire , NanoCore , and LokiBot .
Example email subjects include :
 CORONAVIRUS ( COVID-19 ) UPDATE // BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN ANNOUNCEMENT STARTING MARCH 2020
Latest corona-virus updates
UNICEF COVID-19 TIPS APP
POEA HEALTH ADVISORY re-2020 Novel Corona Virus
WARNING !
CORONA VIRUS .
Example file attachment names include :
 AWARENESS NOTICE ON CORONAVIRUS COVID-19 DOCUMENT_pdf.exe
Coronavirus COVID-19 upadte.xlsx
CORONA VIRUS1.uue
CORONA VIRUS AFFECTED CREW AND VESSEL.xlsm
covid19.ZIP .
Neither of these lists is exhaustive and new variants on these themes will quickly emerge .
We ’  ve also identified malicious emails using subjects containing COVID-19 and related keywords to deliver ransomware ( e.g .
EDA2 ) and info stealer malware ( e.g .
AgentTesla ) in attacks across various industries .
Target industries include , but are not limited to , government healthcare organization , medical research universities , industrial manufacturing firms , and research institutes .
Example email subject lines include : Coronavirus disease , COVID19 .
Example file attachment names include : 20200323-sitrep-63-covid-19.doc .
Example file attachment names include : COVID-19 Supplier Notice/COVID-19 Supplier Notice.jpg.exe .
Example file attachment names include : Corporate advisory CoronaVirus ( Covid-19 )/Corporate advisory Co .
Expect these attacks to continue in the coming weeks and months .
As the news evolves , the attackers will adapt .
We simultaneously see the same attacks using common themes related to tax filing , invoices , and shipping orders .
As people seek out information about COVID-19 , how it is impacting them , and how they can stay safe , many are looking to their smartphone for help .
There have already been multiple cases reported of malicious Android applications that claim to offer information about the virus .
These allow the attacker to spy on you through your devices , or encrypt your device and hold it for ransom .
As always , Android users should not install applications from untrusted sources ( stick to the Google Play store ) and iPhone users should not jailbreak their phones and install apps from third-party sources ( stick to the App Store ) .
In the past few weeks , thousands ( in fact over 100,000 ) of domains have been registered containing terms like “ covid , ”  “ virus ”  , and “ corona ” .
We ’  ve identified 116,357 newly registered domains with coronavirus-related names between January 1 and March 31 .
Out of these , 2,022 are classified as “ malicious ”  and more than 40,000 are considered “ high-risk ”  .
Additionally , from February 1 to March 31 , we witnessed a 569% growth in malicious domain registrations , preying on consumers with some of the following tactics :
 Fake webshops :  Scam websites that offered high-demand items like face masks or hand sanitizers for a discounted price .
Credit card skimmers :  Scripts on other malicious stores that sell pandemic-relevant goods to steal credit card information .
Fake ebooks :  Domains set up to prey into consumer fear and coerce them into buying COVID-19 ebooks by playing a video about the scariest situations and events related to the pandemic .
Illicit pharmacies :  Unlicensed and leverage compromised websites that use domain names suggesting they sell remedies for COVID-19 when they actually advertise Viagra and other drugs unrelated to the virus .
Not all newly registered coronavirus-related domains will be malicious , but all of them should be treated as suspect .
Whether they claim to have information , a testing kit , or a cure , the fact that the website didn’t exist until the pandemic became news should make you very skeptical of their validity .
Between March 24 , 2020 at 18:25 UTC and March 26 at 11:54 UTC , Unit 42 observed several malicious emails sent from the spoofed address noreply@who.int ( actual sender IP address at the time of the attack was 176.223.133.91 ) to several individuals associated with a Canadian government health organization actively engaged in COVID-19 response efforts , and a Canadian university conducting COVID-19 research .
The emails all contained a malicious Rich Text Format ( RTF ) phishing lure with the file name 20200323-sitrep-63-covid-19.doc , ( SHA256 :  62d38f19e67013ce7b2a84cb17362c77e2f13134ee3f8743cbadde818483e617 ) .
When opened with a vulnerable application , it attempts to deliver EDA2 , an open-source ransomware variant associated with a larger , parent ransomware family called HiddenTear .
This ransomware payload , when opened with a vulnerable application , attempts to deliver the ransomware payload using a known shared Microsoft component vulnerability , CVE-2012-0158 .
Malspam actors are also taking advantage of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic crisis , as we found malware droppers distributed to a number of our customers within the healthcare , pharmaceutical and government industries ( among others ) .
These phishing emails attempted to deliver variants of the AgentTesla malware family , which is an info-stealing malware that ’  s been around since 2014 .
Attackers were also found hosting a RedLine Stealer sample at the URL covid-19-gov.com within a ZIP file .
When the contents of the ZIP file are extracted , the RedLine Stealer binary was revealed to have the filename Covid-Locator.exe .
In general , the best practices we recommend are still the right way to keep your organization and your network protected from these threats .
Our products and services are just as capable at preventing threats using COVID-19 related themes as they are for other messages that track users into clicking links and opening attachments .
Consider taking the following actions to ensure you are taking advantage of our protection :
 Run a Best Practice Assessment to identify where your configuration could be altered to improve your security posture .
Use PAN-DB URL Filtering to block the “ Newly-Registered Domains ”  , which contains domains registered in the last 32 days .
While these may not all be malicious , it could prevent your users from succumbing to scams .
This post was last updated on April 27 to reflect the latest campaigns and scams that Unit 42 researchers have detected and stopped .
We will continue updating this blog as new information related to this threat comes to light .
