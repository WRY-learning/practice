For more than two years , the Global Research and Analysis Team ( GReAT ) at Kaspersky has been publishing quarterly summaries of advanced persistent threat ( APT ) activity .
The summaries are based on our threat intelligence research and provide a representative snapshot of what we have published and discussed in greater detail in our private APT reports .
They are designed to highlight the significant events and findings that we feel people should be aware of .
This is our latest installment , focusing on activities that we observed during Q1 2020 .
Readers who would like to learn more about our intelligence reports or request more information on a specific report are encouraged to contact ‘ intelreports@kaspersky.com ’ .
Given the exceptional situation the world is living in because of the COVID-19 pandemia , it is mandatory we to start with a summary of how APT groups have been abusing this topic for different types of attacks .
Since the World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared the COVID-19 a pandemic , this topic has received increased attention from different attackers .
Many of the phishing scams we ’ve seen have been launched by cybercriminals trying to cash-in on people ’s fears about the virus .
However , the list of attackers also includes APT threat actors such as Kimsuky , APT27 , Lazarus or ViciousPanda who , according to OSINT , have used COVID-19-themed lures to target their victims .
We recently discovered a suspicious infrastructure that could have been used to target health and humanitarian organizations , including the WHO .
Even though the infrastructure cannot be attributed to any particular actor at the moment , and was registered before the COVID-19 crisis in June 2019 , according to some private sources it might be related to the DarkHotel actor .
However , we cannot confirm this information at the moment .
Interestingly , some groups have used the current situation to try to soften their reputation by declaring that they would not target health organizations during the crisis .
There are different publications reporting activity related to other APT actors using this lure , but in general , we do not believe this implies a meaningful change in terms of TTPs other than using a trendy topic for luring victims .
We are closely monitoring the situation .
In January 2020 , we discovered a watering-hole utilizing a full remote iOS exploit chain .
This site appears to have been designed to target users in Hong Kong , based on the content of the landing page .
While the exploits currently being used are known , the actor responsible is actively modifying the exploit kit to target more iOS versions and devices .
We observed the latest modifications on February 7 .
The project is broader than we initially thought , supporting an Android implant , and probably supporting implants for Windows , Linux , and MacOS .
For the time being , we are calling this APT group TwoSail Junk .
We believe this is a Chinese-speaking group ; it maintains infrastructure mostly within Hong Kong , along with a couple of hosts located in Singapore and Shanghai .
TwoSail Junk directs visitors to its exploit site by posting links within the threads of forum discussions , or creating new topic threads ofтtheir own .
To date , dozens of visits were recorded from within Hong Kong , with a couple from Macau .
The technical details around the functionality of the iOS implant , called LightSpy , and related infrastructure , reveal a low-to-mid capable actor .
However , the iOS implant is a modular and exhaustively functional iOS surveillance framework .
In January , a couple of recently compiled SPLM/XAgent modules were detected in an Eastern European telecoms company .
The initial point of entry is unknown , as is their lateral movement within this organization .
It has become rare to identify SPLM infections , compared to past levels of Sofacy activity , so it seems that portions of this network may have been infected for some time .
In addition to these SPLM modules , Sofacy also deployed .NET XTUNNEL variants and their loaders .
These 20KB XTUNNEL samples themselves seem minimal in comparison to past XTUNNEL samples , which weighed in at 1-2MB .
This shift to C# by the long-standing Sofacy XTunnel codebase reminds us of Zebrocy ’s practice of re-coding and innovating long-used modules in multiple languages .
Gamaredon , a well-known APT group that has been active since at least 2013 , has traditionally focused on Ukrainian entities .
In recent months we have observed a campaign , made up of different waves , that has also been reported by multiple researchers on different social networks .
The attackers sent malicious documents with remote template injection , resulting in a multi-level infection scheme to deploy a malicious loader that periodically contacts a remote C2 to download additional samples .
Based on past research , we know that the Gamaredon ’s toolkit includes many different malware artefacts , developed to achieve different goals .
These include scanning drives for specific system files , capturing screenshots , executing remote commands , downloading additional files and managing the remote machine with programs such as UltraVNC .
In this case , we observed an interesting new second stage payload that includes spreading capabilities , that we call “ Aversome infector ” .
This malware seems to have been developed to maintain a strong persistence in the target network and to move laterally by infecting Microsoft Word and Excel documents on external drives .
CactusPete is a Chinese-speaking cyber-espionage group active since at least 2012 characterized by medium-level technical capabilities .
Historically , this threat actor has targeted organizations within a limited range of countries – South Korea , Japan , the US and Taiwan .
At the end of 2019 the group seemed to shift towards a heavier focus on Mongolian and Russian organizations .
CactusPete offensive activity against the Russian defense industry and Mongolian government appears to be mostly delineated from its Russian-Mongolian commercial and border relationships .
However , one bait exploit document dropping its Flapjack backdoor ( tmplogon.exe , primarily focused on new Russian targets ) is authored in Mongolian .
The group ’s broadening of techniques , exploit re-purposing , targeting shift and possible expansion suggests changes in the group ’s resources and operations .
Rancor is a group that has been publicly reported since 2018 , with connections to DragonOK .
This actor traditionally had a focus on Southeast Asian targets , namely Cambodia , Vietnam and Singapore .
We noted several updates to the group ’s activity in the last few months , namely the discovery of a new variant of the Dudell malware that we are calling ExDudell , a new tool for bypassing UAC ( User Account Control ) , and new infrastructure utilized in the attacks .
Apart from this , we have also identified that the initial lure documents that were previously sent via mail , are now found in the Telegram Desktop directory , suggesting the group is possibly making a shift in its initial delivery method .
In 2019 , we detected activity by an unknown actor at the time deploying watering holes on websites representing Tibetan interests , fooling victims into installing fake Adobe Flash updates hosted on a GitHub repository .
Kaspersky thwarted the attack by coordinating a takedown of this repository with GitHub .
After a brief period of inactivity , we detected a new round of watering holes featuring a renewed toolset .
We decided to call the group behind this activity Holy Water .
The threat actor ’s unsophisticated but creative toolset has been evolving a lot since the inception date , may still be in development , and leverages Sojson obfuscation , NSIS installer , Python , open-source code , GitHub distribution , Go language , as well as Google Drive-based C2 channels .
We recently detected a new , ongoing data exfiltration campaign targeting victims in Turkey that started in February 2020 .
While StrongPity ’s TTPs in terms of targeting , infrastructure and infection vector haven’t changed , we observed a somewhat peculiar change in the documents they attempt to exfiltrate .
In this campaign , StrongPity updated its latest signature backdoor , named StrongPity2 , and added more files to exfiltrate to its list of common Office and PDF documents , including Dagesh Pro Word Processor files used for Hebrew dotting , RiverCAD files used for river flow and bridge modelling , plain-text files , archives as well as GPG encrypted files and PGP keys .
In March , we discovered a targeted campaign to distribute Milum , a Trojan designed to gain remote control of devices in target organizations , some of which operate in the industrial sector .
The first signs of this operation , which we have dubbed WildPressure , can be traced back to August 2019 ; still , the campaign remains active .
The Milum samples we have seen so far do not share any code similarities with any known APT campaigns .
The malware provides attackers with remote control over infected devices , allows downloading and executing commands , collecting and exfiltrating information and installing upgrades in the malware .
In late December 2019 , Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine detected a new variant of the Zerocleare wiper that had possibly been used in targeted attacks on energy sector targets in Saudi Arabia .
This quarter , we identified a new variant of this wiper , called Dustman .
It is similar to Zerocleare in terms of wiping and distribution , but changes in variables and technical names suggest this might have been in readiness for a new wave of attacks specifically targeting Saudi Arabia ’s energy sector , based on messages embedded in the malware and the mutex created by it .
The PDB file of the Dustman wiper suggested that this destructive code was the release edition and was ready for deployment in a target network .
These changes coincided with the New Year holidays , during which many employees take time off to celebrate .
Shamoon was delivered with similar timing in 2012 during Ramadan celebrations .
A Lazarus campaign outlined by the Italian security company Telsy in November 2019 allowed us to find a connection to previous activity from the group targeting cryptocurrency businesses .
The malware mentioned on Telsy ’s blog is a first stage downloader that has been observed since mid-2018 .
We found that the second stage malware is a variant of Manuscrypt , uniquely attributed to Lazarus , deploying two types of payloads .
The first is a manipulated Ultra VNC program , and the second is a multi-stage backdoor .
This type of multi-stage infection procedure is typical of the Lazarus group ’s malware , especially when using the Manuscrypt variant .
In this campaign , our telemetry indicates that the Lazarus group attacked cryptocurrency businesses in Cyprus , the US , Taiwan and Hong Kong , and the campaign extended until the beginning of 2020 .
Kimsuky , an actor we have been tracking since 2013 , was especially active during 2019 .
In December , Microsoft took down 50 domains used by the group and filed a lawsuit against the attackers in a Virginia court .
However , the group has continued its activity without significant changes .
We recently discovered a new campaign where the actor used a decoy image themed around New Year ’s greetings that delivers its old downloader with a new evolved next-stage payload designed to steal information that uses a new encryption method .
At the end of January , we stumbled upon a malicious script exploiting an Internet Explorer vulnerability , CVE-2019-1367 .
After closely examining the payload and finding connections with previous activity , we concluded that DarkHotel was behind this campaign , probably in progress since 2018 .
The campaign saw DarkHotel utilize a multi-stage binary infection phase using home-brewed malware .
The initial infection creates a downloader which fetches another downloader to collect system information and fetch the final backdoor only for high-value victims .
DarkHotel used a unique combination of TTPs in this campaign .
The threat actor used diverse infrastructure to host malware and to control infected victims , including a compromised web server , a commercial hosting service , a free hosting service and a free source code tracking system .
We were able to confirm targeted companies in South Korea and Japan in this campaign .
In March , researchers from Google revealed that a group of hackers used five zero-days to target North Koreans and North Korean-focused professionals in 2019 .
The group exploited flaws in Internet Explorer , Chrome , and Windows with phishing emails that carried malicious attachments or links to malicious sites , as well as watering-hole attacks .
We were able to match two of the vulnerabilities – one in IE and one in Windows – to DarkHotel .
FunnyDream is a campaign that started in mid-2018 , targeting high-profile entities in Malaysia , Taiwan and the Philippines , with the majority of victims in Vietnam .
Our analysis revealed that it ’s part of a wider campaign that stretches back a few years and targets governments , and specifically foreign organizations , of countries in Southeast Asia .
The attacker ’s backdoor downloads and uploads files from/to a C2 , executes commands and runs new processes in the victim .
It also collects information about other hosts on the network and is delivered to new hosts through remote execution utilities .
The attacker also used an RTL backdoor and Chinoxy backdoor .
The C2 infrastructure has been active since mid-2018 and domains show an overlap with the FFRAT malware family .
In a number of cases , indications suggest the backdoor was delivered via a previous long-term compromise .
The campaign is still active .
Operation AppleJeus was one of the more notable campaigns of Lazarus , and the first time the actor targeted macOS targets .
Our January follow-up research revealed significant changes to the group ’s attack methodology : homemade macOS malware and an authentication mechanism to carefully deliver the next-stage payload , as well as loading the next-stage payload without touching the disk .
To attack Windows victims , the group has elaborated a multi-stage infection procedure and significantly changed the final payload .
We believe that Lazarus has been more careful in its attacks since the release of Operation AppleJeus and has employed a number of methods to avoid detection .
We identified several victims in the UK , Poland , Russia and China .
Moreover , we were able to confirm that several of the victims are linked to cryptocurrency organizations .
Roaming Mantis is a financially motivated actor first reported in 2017 , when it used SMS to distribute its malware to Android devices based in South Korea .
Since then , the scope of the group ’s activities has widened considerably , supporting 27 languages , targeting iOS as well as Android , and even mining cryptocurrency .
The actor also added new malware families , including Fakecop and Wroba.j to its arsenal , and is still active using ‘ SMiShing ‘ for Android malware distribution .
In a recent campaign it distributed malicious APKs masquerading as popular couriers and customized for the targeted countries , including Japan , Taiwan , South Korea and Russia .
TransparentTribe started using a new module named USBWorm at the beginning of 2019 , as well as improving its custom .NET tool named CrimsonRAT .
Based on our telemetry , USBWorm was used to infect thousands of victims , most of them located in Afghanistan and India , providing the attacker with the ability to download and execute arbitrary files , spread to removable devices and steal files of interest from infected hosts even those disconnected from the internet .
As we previously reported , this group mainly focuses on military targets , which are usually compromised with Office documents armed with malicious VBA and open-source malware like Peppy RAT and CrimsonRAT .
In its new campaign , which is still active , we noticed the group ’s focus shift more towards targeting entities located in Afghanistan in addition to India .
Transparent Tribe has also developed a new implant designed to infect Android devices , a modified version of the AhMyth Android RAT which is open source malware available on GitHub .
During the last months of 2019 , we observed an ongoing campaign conducted by Fishing Elephant .
The group continues to use both Heroku and Dropbox in order to deliver its tool of choice , AresRAT .
We discovered that the actor incorporated a new technique into its operations that is meant to hinder manual and automatic analysis – geo-fencing and hiding executables within certificate files .
During our research , we also detected a change in victimology that may reflect the current interests of the threat actor : the group is targeting government and diplomatic entities in Turkey , Pakistan , Bangladesh , Ukraine and China .
While the threat landscape isn’t always full of “ groundbreaking ” events , when we cast our eyes back over the activities of APT threat actors , there are always interesting developments .
Our regular quarterly reviews are intended to highlight the key developments .
These are some of the main trends that we ’ve seen this year so far .
It ’s clear from the activities of various APT groups , including CactusPete , LightSpy , Rancor , Holy Water , TwoSail Junk and others that geo-politics continues to be an important driver of APT activity .
This was also underlined this quarter by the UK National Cyber Security Centre laying responsibility for disruptive attacks on Georgia at the feet of Russia ’s military intelligence service , indictments in the US of two Chinese nationals for laundering $100 million in cryptocurrency on behalf of North Korea and the alleged ‘ catfishing ’ of IDF soldiers by Hamas .
Financial gain remains a motive for some threat actors , as evidenced by the activities of Lazarus and Roaming Mantis .
Southeast Asia is the most active region in terms of APT activities , including established actors such as Lazarus , DarkHotel and Kimsuky , and newer groups such as Cloud Snooper and Fishing Elephant .
APT threat actors such as CactusPete , TwoSail Junk , FunnyDream , DarkHotel continue to exploit software vulnerabilities .
APT threat actors continue to include mobile implants in their arsenal .
APT threat actors such as ( but not limited to ) Kimsuky , Hades and DarkHotel , as well as opportunistic criminals , are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic .
All in all , we see the continuous growth of activity in Asia and how some of the actors we called newcomers are now well established .
On the other hand , the more traditional advanced actors seem to be more and more selective in their operations , probably following a change of paradigm .
The use of mobile platforms for infections and the distribution of malware is on the rise .
Every actor seems to have some artefacts for these platforms and in some campaigns they are the main target .
COVID-19 is clearly top of everyone ’s minds at the moment and APT threat actors have also been seeking to exploit this topic in spear-phishing campaigns .
We do not believe this represents a meaningful change in terms of TTPs : they ’re simply using it as a newsworthy topic to lure their victims .
However , we are closely monitoring the situation .
As always , we would note that our reports are the product of our visibility into the threat landscape .
However , it should be borne in mind that , while we strive to continually improve , there is always the possibility that other sophisticated attacks may fly under our radar .
