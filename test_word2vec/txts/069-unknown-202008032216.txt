Threat Assessment : WastedLocker Ransomware Activities .

Unit 42 has observed a recent uptick in WastedLocker ransomware activity , which has increased since the initial samples were analyzed by WildFire in May 2020 . 
In light of this , together with recent media coverage around large U.S. corporations being targeted by the threat , we have created this general assessment of the ransomware .
WastedLocker is post-intrusion ransomware of the same ilk as Samsa , Maze , EKANS , Ryuk , BitPaymer and others . 
This type of ransomware differs from large-volume , victim-agnostic ransomware variants like WannaCry by targeting an organization perceived as having a large amount of assets , successfully breaching it , and then deploying specially crafted ransomware to as many systems as possible within that organization in a short timeframe to maximize impact and increase chances of receiving a much larger ransom payment .
On June 23 , 2020 , NCC Group published a report providing a detailed overview of the WastedLocker ransomware , including information on the group believed to be behind it , Evil Corp . 
In the past , this group has been responsible for the Dridex banking Trojan and other related threats and campaigns .
Using our threat intelligence platform , AutoFocus , Unit 42 has identified some possible targets for the actors behind WastedLocker . 
The majority of organizations are based in the U.S. , which ties in with activity reported by Symantec on June 26 , 2020 . 
The organizations operate in various sectors , including professional and legal services , utilities and energy , manufacturing , wholesale and retail , high tech , engineering , pharma and life sciences , and transportation and logistics ( including one transportation and logistics organization from the United Kingdom that appears to have operations in the U.S ) .
According to previously reported WastedLocker activity by Symantec , the most commonly observed initial infection mechanism for WastedLocker attacks are ZIP files ( likely disguised as legitimate software updates ) containing malicious SocGholish JavaScript framework loader components that profile the victim system and use PowerShell to ultimately deploy Cobalt Strike payloads .
Once the Cobalt Strike payload is installed on a victim’s machine , it is then used to move laterally through the victim ’s network and facilitate the identification of additional systems on which attackers can deploy their main payloads . 
WastedLocker attackers have also been observed using legitimate Windows utilities such as Windows Management Instrumentation [ WMI ] and PsExec to do this as well .
Of particularly high value to targeted ransomware attackers are systems that directly affect a victim ’s customer-facing revenue-generating business operations , internal systems of high visibility and high use , and systems that contain ( or facilitate the deployment of ) system backups .
Finally , once sufficient reconnaissance of the victim’s network has been conducted , the attackers move to deploy the WastedLocker ransomware payload using one or more system management utilities .
During execution on a target host , the ransomware will : 
Attempt to elevate execution privileges ( if not already running as Administrator ) .
Attempt to disable Windows Defender monitoring .
Delete shadow copies/volume snapshots .
Install itself as a service .
Once installed , the delivery of the payload is complete and files are overwritten . 
The ransomware mainly uses a .<victim name>wasted extension , though files containing ransom note details are appended with a .<victim_name>wasted_info extension .
The *.wasted_info ransom note files we have analyzed thus far resemble the following example where variable data is shown below between <> characters . 
The actor email addresses used can differ , and the domain names include the following ( in most- to least-used order ) : 
PROTONMAIL.CH , AIRMAIL.CC , ECLIPSO.CH , TUTANOTA.COM and PROTONMAIL.COM .
The trend of targeted ransomware attacks is on the rise because they are comparatively more effective and yield higher ransoms than more common forms of “ spray-and-pray ” ransomware attacks similar to the ones observed by Unit 42 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic . 
WastedLocker is a prime example of a targeted ransomware attack . 
The impact a group of determined cybercriminals can have against organizations can be devastating , and the methodologies they utilize only serve to underscore the need for enterprises to employ both robust defensive technologies and capable cybersecurity expertise into their environments .
Palo Alto Networks detects/prevents WastedLocker in the following ways :
WildFire : all known samples are identified as malware .
Cortex XDR Agent with : 
indicators for WastedLocker .
Anti-Ransomware Module to detect WastedLocker encryption behaviors .
Local Analysis detection to detect WastedLocker binaries .
Behavioral Threat Protection ( BTP ) triggers on Volume Shadow Copy being deleted by WastedLocker .
Next-Generation Firewalls : DNS Signatures detect the known command and control ( C2 ) domains , which are also categorized as malware in PAN-DB .
AutoFocus : Tracking related activity using the WastedLocker tag .
