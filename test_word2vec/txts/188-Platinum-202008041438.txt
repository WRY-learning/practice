In June 2018 , we came across an unusual set of samples spreading throughout South and Southeast Asian countries targeting diplomatic , government and military entities .
The campaign , which may have started as far back as 2012 , featured a multi-stage approach and was dubbed EasternRoppels .
The actor behind this campaign , believed to be related to the notorious PLATINUM APT group , used an elaborate , previously unseen steganographic technique to conceal communication .
As a first stage the operators used WMI subscriptions to run an initial PowerShell downloader which , in turn , downloaded another small PowerShell backdoor .
We collected many of the initial WMI PowerShell scripts and noticed that they had different hardcoded command and control ( C&C ) IP addresses , different encryption keys , salt for encryption ( also different for each initial loader ) and different active hours ( meaning the malware only worked during a certain period of time every day ) .
The C&C addresses were located on free hosting services , and the attackers made heavy use of a large number of Dropbox accounts ( for storing the payload and exfiltrated data ) .
The purpose of the PowerShell backdoor was to perform initial fingerprinting of a system since it supported a very limited set of commands : download or upload a file and run a PowerShell script .
At the time , we were investigating another threat , which we believe to be the second stage of the same campaign .
We were able to find a backdoor that was implemented as a DLL and worked as a WinSock NSP ( Nameservice Provider ) to survive a reboot .
The backdoor shares several features with the PowerShell backdoor described above : it has hardcoded active hours , it uses free domains as C&C addresses , etc .
The backdoor also has a few very interesting features of its own .
For example , it can hide all communication with its C&C server by using text steganography .
After deeper analysis we realized that the two threats were related .
Among other things , both attacks used the same domain to store exfiltrated data , and we discovered that some of the victims were infected by both types of malware at the same time .
It ’s worth mentioning that in the second stage , all executable files were protected with a runtime crypter and after unpacking them we found another , previously undiscovered , backdoor that is known to be related to PLATINUM .
Our paper only includes a description of the two previously undiscovered backdoors while the full report is available to customers of the Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting service ( contact intelreports@kaspersky.com ) .
The main binary backdoor is installed with a dedicated dropper .
When the dropper is run , it decrypts files that are embedded into its “ .arch ” section .
Next , it creates directories for the backdoor to operate in and saves the malware-related files in these .
It normally uses paths like those used by legitimate software .
Typically , the malware drops two files : the backdoor itself and its configuration file .
After this , the dropper runs the backdoor , installs it to enable a persistence mechanism and removes itself .
The configuration file always has a .cfg or .dat extension and contains the following options , encrypted with AES-256 CBC and encoded : 
pr – stands for “ Poll Retries ” and specifies the interval in minutes after which the malware sends the C&C server a request for new commands to execute .
ht – unused .
sl – specifies the date and time when the malware starts running .
When the date arrives , the malware clears this option .
opt – stands for “ Office Hours ” .
This specifies the hours and minutes during the day when the malware is active .
die – stands for “ Eradicate Days ” .
This specifies how many days the malware will work inside the victim ’s computer .
Section “ p ” lists malware C&C addresses .
Section “ t ” lists legitimate URLs that will be used to ensure that an internet connection is available .
The main backdoor is implemented as a dynamic link library ( DLL ) and exports a function with the name “ NSPStartup ” .
After dropping it , the installer registers the backdoor as a winsock2 namespace provider with the help of the WSCInstallNameSpace API function and runs it by calling the WSCEnableNSProvider .
As a result of this installation , during initialization of the “ svchost -k netsvcs ” process upon system startup , the registered namespace provider will be loaded into the address space of the process and the function “ NSPStartup ” will be called .
Once up and running , the backdoor compares the current time against the “ Eradicate Days ” , activation date and “ Office Hours ” values , and locates valid proxy credentials in “ Credential Store ” and “ Protected Storage ” .
When all the rules are fulfilled , the backdoor connects to the malware server and downloads an HTML page .
On the face of it , the HTML suggests that the C&C server is down .
However , this is because of the steganography .
The page contains embedded commands that are encrypted with an encryption key , also embedded into the page .
The embedded data is encoded with two steganography techniques and placed inside the <--1234567890> tag ( see below ) .
On line 31 , the attributes “ align ” , “ bgcolor ” , “ colspan ” and “ rowspan ” are listed in alphabetical order , whereas on line 32 , the same attributes are listed in a different order .
The first steganography technique is based on the principle that HTML is indifferent to the order of tag attributes .
We can encode a message by permuting the attributes .
Line 31 in the example above contains four tags ; the number of permutations in the four tags is 4 !
= 24 , so the line encodes log2 ( 24 ) = 4 bits of information .
The backdoor decodes line by line and collects an encryption key for the data , which is placed right after the HTML tags in an encoded state too , but using a second steganography technique .
Each group contains from zero to seven spaces and the number of spaces represents the next three bits of data .
For example , the first group on line 944 contains six spaces , so it will be decoded as 610 = 1102 .
Decryption of the decoded data using the decoded AES-256 CBC key is a logical continuation .
The result is a list of commands to execute , protected the same way as the backdoor configuration file .
The backdoor that we ’ve discovered supports the uploading , downloading and execution of files , it can handle requests for a process list and directory list , upgrade and uninstall itself and modify its configuration file .
Each command has its own parameters , e.g .
the C&C server that it requests to download or upload files , or split a file while uploading .
While investigating further , we found another tool that turned out to be a configuration manager – an executable whose purpose was to create configuration and command files for the backdoors .
The utility can configure more than 150 options .
The second command it supports is updatecfg , whose job was to put values specified by the operator into the configuration file .
Also , the config manager supports Upload , Download , Execute , Search , UpdateConfig , AddKeyword , ChangeKeywordFile , ChangeKey , Upgrade and Uninstall commands .
After executing any of these it creates a command file , protected the same way as the configuration file , and stores it in the “ CommandDir ” directory ( the path is specified in the configuration , option 11 ) .
As described in the ‘ Steganography backdoor ’ section , this backdoor doesn’t handle command files and doesn’t support commands such as ChangeKeywordFile and ChangeKey , so we figured that there was another backdoor , which made a pair with the config manager we had found .
Although it would appear such a utility should run on the attacker side , we found a victim infected with this and a corresponding backdoor located in the vicinity .
We called it a P2P backdoor .
This backdoor shares many features with the previous one .
For example , many of the commands have similar names , both backdoors ’ configuration files have options with identical names and are protected the same way , and the paths to the backdoor files are similar to legitimate ones .
However , there are significant differences , too .
The new backdoor actively uses many more of the options from the config , supports more commands , is capable of interacting with other infected victims and connecting them into a network ( see the “ Commands ” section for details ) , and works with the C&C server in a different way .
In addition , this backdoor actively uses logging : we found a log file dating back to 2012 on one victim PC .
This backdoor has the ability to sniff network traffic .
After the backdoor is run , it starts a sniffer for each network interface , in order to detect a specially structured packet , which is sent to the victim ’s ProbePort specified in the configuration .
When the sniffer finds a packet like that , it interprets it as a request to establish a connection and sets TransferPort ( specified in the configuration ) to listening mode .
The requester immediately connects to the victim ’s TransferPort and both sides perform additional checks , exchanging their encryption keys .
Then the connection requester sends commands to the victim , and the victim processes these interactively .
This approach allows the backdoor to maintain listening mode without keeping any socket in listening mode – it only creates a listening socket when it knows that someone is trying to connect .
The backdoor supports the same commands as the steganography backdoor and implements an additional one .
The backdoor leverages the Windows index service and can search files for keywords provided by the attacker .
This search can be initiated by an attacker request or on a schedule – keywords for a scheduled search are stored in a dedicated file .
All commands are supplied to the backdoor through command files .
The command files are protected the same way as the config .
This consists of a command id ( id ) , a command date ( dt ) , a command name ( t ) and arguments ( cmd ) .
The creators of the malware also provide the ability to combine infected victims into a P2P network .
This can help the attacker , for example , when two infected victims share the same local network , but only one of them has access to the internet .
In this case , the attacker can send a command file to the unreachable victim via the reachable one .
The instruction for the reachable victim that the command is intended for the other host is placed directly inside the command file .
When the attacker prepares the file , a list of infected hosts involved in transferring the file to the destination is included as the h1 , h2 , h3 , etc .
options .
The order in which the command file will be transferred through the victims to the destination host is included as the p1 , p2 , etc .
options .
For example , if the p1 option equals ‘ 2->3->1 ’ and the p2 option equals to ‘ 2->3->4 ’ the command file will be delivered to the hosts with the indexes 1 and 4 through hosts 2 and then 3 .
Each host is described as follows : %Host IP% : %Host ProbePort% : %Host TransferPort% .
We have discovered a new attack by this group and noted that the actors are still working on improving their malicious utility and using new techniques for making the APT stealthier .
A couple of years ago , we predicted that more and more APT and malware developers would use steganography , and here is proof : the actors used two interesting steganography techniques in this APT .
One more interesting detail is that the actors decided to implement the utilities they need as one huge set – this reminds us of the framework-based architecture that is becoming more and more popular .
Finally , based on the custom cryptor used by the actors , we have been able to attribute this attack to the notorious PLATINUM group , which means this group is still active .
This list includes only IoCs related to the described modules of the attack .
