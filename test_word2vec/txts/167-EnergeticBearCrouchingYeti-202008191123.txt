Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti: attacks on servers
Release_Time : 2018-04-23
Report_URL : https://securelist.com/energetic-bear-crouching-yeti/85345/
Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti is a widely known APT group active since at least 2010 .
The group tends to attack different companies with a strong focus on the energy and industrial sectors .
Companies attacked by Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti are geographically distributed worldwide with a more obvious concentration in Europe and the US .
In 2016-2017 , the number of attacks on companies in Turkey increased significantly .
The main tactics of the group include sending phishing emails with malicious documents and infecting various servers .
The group uses some of the infected servers for auxiliary purposes – to host tools and logs .
Others are deliberately infected to use them in waterhole attacks in order to reach the group's main targets .
Recent activity of the group against US organizations was discussed in a US-CERT advisory , which linked the actor to the Russian government , as well as an advisory by the UK National Cyber Security Centre .
This report by Kaspersky Lab ICS CERT presents information on identified servers that have been infected and used by the group .
The report also includes the findings of an analysis of several webservers compromised by the Energetic Bear group during 2016 and in early 2017 .
Victims of the threat actor's attacks were not limited to industrial companies .
Compromised servers : 
Russia Opposition political website Waterhole .
Russia Real estate agency Auxiliary ( collecting user data in the waterhole attack ) .
Russia Football club Waterhole .
Russia Developer and integrator of secure automation systems and IS consultant Waterhole .
Russia Developers of software and equipment Auxiliary ( collecting user data in the waterhole attack , tool hosting ) .
Russia Investment website Auxiliary ( collecting user data in the waterhole attack ) .
Ukraine	Electric power sector company Waterhole .
Ukraine	Bank Waterhole .
UK	Aerospace company Waterhole .
Germany	Software developer and integrator Waterhole .
Germany	Unknown Auxiliary ( collecting user data in the waterhole attack ) .
Turkey	Oil and gas sector enterprise Waterhole .
Turkey	Industrial group Waterhole .
Turkey	Investment group Waterhole .
Greece	Server of a university Auxiliary ( collecting user data in the waterhole attack ) .
USA	Oil and gas sector enterprise Waterhole .
Unknown	Affiliate network site Auxiliary ( collecting user data in the waterhole attack ) .
All waterhole servers are infected following the same pattern : injecting a link into a web page or JS file with the following file scheme : file://IP/filename.png .
The link is used to initiate a request for an image , as a result of which the user connects to the remote server over the SMB protocol .
In this attack type , the attackers' goal is to extract the following data from the session : 
user IP
user name
domain name
NTLM hash of the user's password .
In the process of analyzing infected servers , numerous websites and servers were identified that the attackers had scanned with various tools , such as nmap , dirsearch , sqlmap , etc .
Even though the scanned servers do not necessarily look like potential final victims , it is likely that the attackers scanned different resources to find a server that could be used to establish a foothold for hosting the attackers' tools and , subsequently , to develop the attack .
Part of the sites scanned may have been of interest to the attackers as candidates for hosting waterhole resources .
In some cases , the domains scanned were hosted on the same server , sometimes the attackers went through the list of possible domains matching a given IP .
In most cases , multiple attempts to compromise a specific target were not identified - with the possible exception of sites on the Bump platform , flight tracker servers and servers of a Turkish hotel chain .
Curiously , the sites scanned included a web developer's website , kashey.ru , and resources links to which were found on this site .
These may have been links to resources developed by the site's owner : www.esodedi.ru , www.i-stroy.ru , www.saledoor.ru .
In addition , a custom Python script named ftpChecker.py was found on one of the servers .
The script was designed to check FTP hosts from an incoming list .
The following malicious php files were found in different directories in the nginx folder and in a working directory created by the attackers on an infected web servers : 
ini.php wso shell+ mail f3e3e25a822012023c6e81b206711865 2016-07-01 15:57:38 28786bytes .

In the table above : 
Web shell is a script that allows remote administration of the machine .
WSO is a popular web shell and file manager ( it stands for "Web Shell by Orb" ) that has the ability to masquerade as an error page containing a hidden login form .
It is available on GitHub : https://github.com/wso-shell/WSO .
Two of the PHP scripts found , ini.php and mysql.php , contained a WSO shell concatenated with the following email spamming script : https://github.com/bediger4000/php-malware-analysis/tree/master/db-config.php .
All the scripts found are obfuscated .
One of the web shells was found on the server under two different names ( proxy87.php and code29.php ) .
It uses the eval function to execute a command sent via HTTP cookies or a POST request .
A modified sshd with a preinstalled backdoor was found in the process of analyzing the server .
Patches with some versions of backdoors for sshd that are similar to the backdoor found are available on GitHub , for example : https://github.com/jivoi/openssh-backdoor-kit .
As a result of replacing the original sshd file with a modified one on the infected server , an attacker can use a 'master password' to get authorized on the remote server , while leaving minimal traces ( compared to an ordinary user connecting via ssh ) .
In addition , the modified sshd logs all legitimate ssh connections ( this does not apply to the connection that uses the 'master password' ) , including connection times , account names and passwords .
The log is encrypted and is located at /var/tmp/.pipe.sock .
After gaining access to the server , the attackers installed the tools they needed at different times .
Specifically , the following commands for third-party installations were identified on one of the servers : 
apt install traceroute
apt-get install nmap
apt-get install screen
git clone https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git .
Additionally , the attackers installed any packages and tools for Python they needed .
The attackers checked the smbtrap log file on working days .
In addition , in the process of performing the analysis , an active process was identified that exploited SQL injection and collected data from a database of one of the victims .
The findings of the analysis of compromised servers and the attackers' activity on these servers are as follows : 
With rare exceptions , the group's members get by with publicly available tools .
The use of publicly available utilities by the group to conduct its attacks renders the task of attack attribution without any additional group 'markers' very difficult .
Potentially , any vulnerable server on the internet is of interest to the attackers when they want to establish a foothold in order to develop further attacks against target facilities .
In most cases that we have observed , the group performed tasks related to searching for vulnerabilities , gaining persistence on various hosts , and stealing authentication data .
The diversity of victims may indicate the diversity of the attackers' interests .
It can be assumed with some degree of certainty that the group operates in the interests of or takes orders from customers that are external to it , performing initial data collection , the theft of authentication data and gaining persistence on resources that are suitable for the attack's further development .
